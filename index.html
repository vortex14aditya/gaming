                <h3>GTA VI</h3>
                <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) had not been officially released, and specific details about the game were not available. Rockstar Games, the developer of the Grand Theft Auto series, had not made any official announcements regarding the release or details of GTA 6.

It's essential to note that information about video games, especially those in development, can change over time. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on GTA 6, I recommend checking official announcements from Rockstar Games, their official website, or reputable gaming news sources.

As of my last update, Rockstar Games tends to keep details about their projects tightly under wraps until they are ready to make an official announcement. For the latest information, please refer to more recent sources or the official channels of Rockstar Games..</p>
